/**
  * A canvas interface abstracts over the different vector drawing libraries we
  * support. It provides a low-level imperative API, the higher-level
  * declarative APIs can compile into.
  *
  * We implement this as an open trait (vs sealed trait) as the different
  * implementations live in different packages and type classes don't work well
  * with stateful interfaces.
  *
  * We assume the origin is centered in the drawing context, and coordinates
  * follow the standard cartesian layout. The Canvas implementation is
  * responsible for translating this coordinate system to whatever is used
  * by the specific implementation it draws to.
  *
  * Callers can change the origin to another location to, for example, center an
  * image in the canvas (if that image is itself not centered on the origin)
