# Doodle: Compositional Graphics

Copyright 2015 [Underscore](http://underscore.io).

A Scala library for compositional vector graphics,
with a native back-end via Swing and Java2D,
and an HTML canvas backend via [Scala.js](http://www.scala-js.org/).

# Using Doodle 

You can use Doodle in your own project by importing the JARs published to our [Bintray repository][bintray-training]. The current release is **`0.3.0`**. To use it add the following to your `build.sbt`:

[bintray-training]: https://bintray.com/underscoreio/training/doodle

~~~ scala
scalaVersion := "2.11.8" // Doodle is compatible with Scala 2.11 only

resolvers += Resolver.bintrayRepo("underscoreio", "training")

libraryDependencies += "underscoreio" %% "doodle" % "0.3.0"
~~~

Alternatively you can `git clone` or download Doodle and use it directly from the SBT console. See the instructions below.

# Documentation

[Creative Scala][creative-scala] is currently the main documentation for Doodle. Creative Scala is a free introductory Scala ebook. Follow the link to download your copy from our web site.

Below we have a few tips to get you started.

## Getting Started from SBT

1.  Start SBT:

    ~~~ bash
    bash$ sbt

    > # This is the SBT prompt. Press Ctrl+D to quit to the OS.
    ~~~

2.  Start the console:

    ~~~ coffee
    > console

    scala> # This is the Scala prompt. Press Ctrl+D to quit to SBT.
    ~~~

3.  Use Scala commands to draw a shape in a native window:

    ~~~ scala
    scala> (circle(10) fillColor Color.red).draw
    ~~~

    A window should appear containing a red circle.

## Drawing in the Browser

You can also draw Doodle pictures in the browser. The process is slightly different.

1.  Write your code in `js/src/main/scala/Main.scala`

2.  Start SBT:

    ~~~ bash
    bash$ sbt

    > # This is the SBT prompt. Press Ctrl+D to quit to the OS.
    ~~~

3.  Compile the JS version:

    ~~~ scala
    > fastOptJS
    ~~~

4.  Open your browser and point to `http://localhost:12345/index.html`
    to see an HTML 5 canvas version of the code.

## Viewing the Examples

Doodle ships with a set of examples for each of the exercises in Creative Scala.
See the `shared/src/main/scala/doodle/examples` directory for a complete list.

To view an example, simply run the sbt console, and draw the examples from there. For example:

~~~ bash
bash$ sbt console
~~~

When the console is running, type

~~~ coffee
scala> Sierpinski.image.draw
~~~

# Directory Structure

Source code is in the following directories:

~~~ coffee
 - shared / src / {main,test} / scala
 - jvm    / src / {main,test} / scala
 - js     / src / {main,test} / scala
~~~

# SBT Commands

We provide three quick aliases for common commands:

~~~ coffee
> console   runs the console using the JVM codebase
> fastOptJS compiles the JS codebase
> test      runs the unit tests for both codebases
~~~
